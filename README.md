<p align= "justify"> In this Project, we have tried to implement the Novel Technique for Task Scheduling on Heterogeneous Systems proposed in the research paper mentioned above. A <strong>Novel Task Duplication based Clustering Algorithm (TDCA)</strong> is proposed to improve the schedule performance by utilizing duplication task more thoroughly. TDCA improves parameter calculation, task duplication, and task merging. It improves the schedule makespan of task duplication-based algorithms for heterogeneous systems for various communication-computing cost ratios. </p>

**TDCA contains three main improvements over existing algorithms:**
* New definitions for key parameters such as EST.
* Improving the initial clustering.
* Consideration of the chain reaction. Keeping alive the prospect of ineffective duplication after some other duplications.
